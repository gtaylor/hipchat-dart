This package is the beginnings of an API client for the HipChat web
API (version 2). While we don't currently support all of the endpoints
offered by HipChat, pull requests of good quality (with tests) will
be accepted quickly.

Documentation
-------------

May be worked on some day. Check out the tests under ``test/client.dart``.
